# The-C-Programming-Language-Exercise-1.16
This is my example of exercise 1.16 as defined in the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie The exercise is defined as such: "Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text."
